# SearchNav

A `SearchNav` is a navigation bar focused on handling dense information interactions.

The `SearchNav.LogoGroup` and `SearchNav.Logo` components are required.

On screen sizes between `640px` and `1024px`, `SearchNav.CTAGroup`, if applicable, collapses into a menu
where each `SearchNav.CTAItem` is transposed onto `Menu.Item`. The `key` provided is directly forwarded.

On screen sizes smaller than `640px`, `SearchNav.CTAGroup` and `SearchNav.Select`, if applicable, collapse into
a single menu where `SearchNav.CTAItem` and `SearchNav.Option` are respectively transposed onto `Menu.Item`.

The `menuOverlayProps` prop can be used to control menu interactions. Note, on screen sizes greater than `640px`,
`menuOverlayProps` has no bearing on `SearchNav.Select` since the data representation only collapses at screen sizes
less than `640px`.

## Selector

`SearchNav.Selector` can be controlled with `onSelectionChange`.

<Canvas of={SearchNavStories.Selector} />

## CTA

Each `CTA.Item` is implemented as a button and hence, can accept `onPress` and `href`.

## Search

`SearchNav.Search` is unopinionated with respect to the search input itself.
