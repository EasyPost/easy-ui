# MultiSelect

The `<MultiSelect />` component is an input with a dropdown that allows users to select multiple options from a list. It's customizable with various props such as `placeholder`, `maxItemsUntilScroll`, and `onSelectionChange`.

## Async Dropdown

The `<MultiSelect />` component can also support asynchronous loading of dropdown items. This is useful for fetching items from a server or a large dataset.

## With Icons

This variant of the `<MultiSelect />` includes icons next to each option. It uses the `renderPill` prop to customize how selected items are displayed, and it can render custom content in the dropdown items.

## Disabled Keys

You can disable specific items from being selected by using the `disabledKeys` prop. This is useful when some options should be unselectable.

## Max Items Until Scroll

When there are too many items to fit in the dropdown, you can set a maximum number of items to display before the dropdown becomes scrollable. The `maxItemsUntilScroll` prop controls this behavior.
