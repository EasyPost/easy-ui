# Pill

A `Pill` is a compact element that displays contextual text typically representing selections or options; they can be dismissed as well as accompanied by an icon.

## Default

<Canvas of={PillStories.Default} />

## Standard Icon

Use the `icon` property to render a `Pill` with a left aligned icon.

<Canvas of={PillStories.StandardIconSymbol} />

## Image

The `icon` property directly passes the argument to the underlying `Icon` component, hence an image can also be passed to `icon`.

<Canvas of={PillStories.ImageSymbol} />

## Dismissal

Use `onDismiss` as a callback for dismissal and to display a right aligned close icon.

<Canvas of={PillStories.Dismissal} />

## Group

Below illustrates a simple example for how one might manage state for a group of Pills. Use `Show code` tab below for details.

<Canvas of={PillStories.Group} />

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={Pill} />
