# Browser Support

For the best experience with Easy UI, we recommend its users to use the latest version of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari.

## About web browser support

We design EasyPost shipping experiences with the latest web browsers in mind. We recommend that users using Easy UI use the latest version of one of the following browsers.

- Apple Safari
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

If users of Easy UI do not use the latest version of a recommended browser, or if you use a browser that is not listed above, some features of Easy UI may not work as you expect, or at all.

## Extended support for recommended web browsers

Some browser vendors provide extended support releases. We do our best to ensure that Easy UI functions properly in the latest extended support release for:

- Chrome's extended stable channel
- Edge's Extended Stable Channel
- Firefox's Extended Support Release (ESR)

In earlier extended support releases, Easy UI may not work as you expect, and some features may not be available.

## Public preview and developer builds

You may encounter unexpected bugs in public preview and developer builds of our supported browsers. If you encounter a bug in Easy UI in one of these unreleased builds, please verify that it also exists in the stable version of the same browser. If the bug only exists in the unstable version, consider reporting the bug to the browser developer and file an issue at Easy UI's Github repo.
