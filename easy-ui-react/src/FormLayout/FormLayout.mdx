# FormLayout

`FormLayout` arranges a layout of form elements with preset spacing.

<Canvas of={FormLayoutStories.Basic} />

Use `FormLayout.Header`, `FormLayout.Tile` and `FormLayout.HelperText` to render a header with title and helper text for the closest `FormLayout` and `FormLayout.Section`.

## Sections

`FormLayout` can be divided into logical sections. Each section is rendered as a `fieldset` with its title as a `legend`.

Use `FormLayout.Section` to introduce a new section to the form.

<Canvas of={FormLayoutStories.Sections} />

## Columns

`FormLayout` and `FormLayout.Section` can be divided into grids using the `FormLayout.Grid` component. Use the `columns` prop to specify the columns configuration.

This is a wrapper around `HorizontalGrid`, so the same rules apply as that component, except with specific spacing built in.

<Canvas of={FormLayoutStories.Columns} />

## Nesting

`FormLayout` can contain any number of levels of `FormLayout.Section`s and `FormLayout.Grid`s to produce complex layouts.

Use with caution as too much nesting can cause users to become disoriented.

<Canvas of={FormLayoutStories.Nesting} />

## As a form element

By default, `FormLayout` renders as a `div`. The underlying element can be controlled with the `as` prop. For example, a `FormLayout` can be a `form` by providing `as="form"`.

Consider adding a `<button type="submit" />` in these cases to provide users with the affordance to submit the form with the keyboard.

## Section with action

`FormLayout`s can be composed with arbitrary markup. For example, wrap a `FormLayout.Section` header with a `HorizontalStack` to provide an action for that section.

<Canvas of={FormLayoutStories.SectionAction} />
