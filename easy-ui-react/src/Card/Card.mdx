# Card

Cards are styled containers that group related content.

## Standard cards

Standard cards are components with minimal configuration. Many times this is all that you need.

Cards are transparent by default in order to let the background come through. Use the `background` prop to set its background to one of either `primary` or `subdued`.

Cards are `solid` by default, meaning they have no border. Use the `variant` prop to adjust the overall style of the `Card`.

### Solid

Cards are solid by default.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Solid} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Solid} />

### Outlined

Cards can be outlined using `variant="outlined"`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Outlined} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Outlined} />

### Flagged

Cards can be flagged using `variant="flagged"`.

Use the `color` prop to adjust the flag's color.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Flagged} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Flagged} />

## Complex cards

Cards are composable. Use `<Card.Container />` and `<Card.Area />` to create cards with complex content.

### Split card

Below is an example of a card that uses the deconstructed subcomponents of `<Card />`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Split} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Split} include={["variant"]} />
