# Card

Cards are styled containers that group related content.

Cards are transparent by default in order to let the background come through. Use the `background` prop to set its background to one of either `primary` or `subdued`.

Cards are `outlined` by default. Use the `variant` prop to adjust the overall style of the `Card`.

Turn on the grid in the individual story to see the effects of card backgrounds more clearly.

## Outlined

By default cards are rendered with a border. This is synonymous with `variant="outlined"`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Outlined} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Outlined} />

## Solid

Cards can be without a border using `variant="solid"`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Solid} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Solid} />

## Flagged

Cards can be flagged using `variant="flagged"`.

Use the `color` prop to adjust the flag's color.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Flagged} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Flagged} />

## Composition

Cards are composable. Use `<Card.Container />` and `<Card.Area />` to create cards with complex content.

`<Card.Container />` is the outermost element of the card containing its border.

`<Card.Area />` is the inner element of the card containing its padding and background.

As an example, to create a card with two columns, use deconstructed subcomponents of `<Card />`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Composition} />
