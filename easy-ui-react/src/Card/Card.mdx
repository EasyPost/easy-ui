# Card

Cards are styled containers that group related content.

## Basic cards

Basic cards are simple containers with preset styles.

Cards are `solid` by default, meaning they have no border. Use the `variant` prop to adjust the overall style of the `Card`. `danger`, `warning`, and `success` variants render a flagged appearance.

Cards are transparent by default. Use the `background` prop to set its background to one of either `primary` or `subdued`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Basic} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Basic} include={["background", "variant"]} />

## Complex cards

Cards are composable. Use `<Card.Container />` and `<Card.Area />` to create cards with complex content.

Below is an example of a card split into two areas using `<HorizontalGrid />`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Complex} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Complex} include={["variant"]} />
