# Stepper

A `<Stepper />` component is used to indicate progress as the user goes through a multi-step process. It can be used to guide a user through a
large form where parts of the form can be separated into logical steps. Each step is represented as `<Stepper.Step />`.

## Horizontal Primary

Use the `Show code` tab below for a relatively detailed example for how the `<Stepper />` can be used; note that state can be handled as the
consumer wishes and the code sample is **not** necessarily production ready.

<Canvas of={StepperStories.HorizontalStepper} />

## Vertical Primary

A vertical orientation can be achieved by setting `orientation="vertical"` on the `<Stepper />`.

<Canvas of={StepperStories.VerticalStepper} />

## Horizontal Inverse

A `<Stepper />` with inverted colors can be achieved by setting `color="inverse"`.

<Canvas of={StepperStories.HorizontalInverseStepper} />

## Vertical Inverse

<Canvas of={StepperStories.VerticalInverseStepper} />
