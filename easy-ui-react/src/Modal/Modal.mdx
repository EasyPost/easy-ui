# Modal

A `<Modal />` is a page overlay that displays information and blocks interaction with the page until an action is taken or the `Modal` is dismissed.

### Modal architecture

`<Modal />` is a compound component. Use `<Modal.Trigger />`, `<Modal />`, `<Modal.Header />`, `<Modal.Body />`, and `<Modal.Footer />` to construct a modal.

```tsx
<Modal.Trigger>
  <Button>Open modal</Button>
  <Modal>
    <Modal.Header>H4 Title</Modal.Header>
    <Modal.Body>Modal content</Modal.Body>
    <Modal.Footer
      primaryAction={{
        content: "Button 1",
        onAction: () => {},
      }}
    />
  </Modal>
</Modal.Trigger>
```

### Triggering the modal

`<Modal.Trigger />` must contain exactly two direct children.

The first child should be a trigger element, such as a `<Button />`, where the trigger events and appropriate accessibility attributes can be applied.

The second element must be a `<Modal />`. If access to programmatically close the modal inline is needed, a child with a function that has a close method and returns a `<Modal />` (`(close) => <Modal />`) can be passed as the second child instead of a `<Modal />`.

_Modal with close function injected:_

```tsx
<Modal.Trigger>
  <Button>Open modal</Button>
  {(close) => (
    <Modal>
      <Modal.Header>H4 Title</Modal.Header>
      <Modal.Body>Modal content</Modal.Body>
      <Modal.Footer
        primaryAction={{
          content: "Button 1",
          onAction: () => {
            // do something
            close();
          },
        }}
      />
    </Modal>
  )}
</Modal.Trigger>
```

### State management

By default, a `<Modal />` manages its own open state.

It can be made to be a controlled component by using the `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` prop on `<Modal.Trigger />`.

It can be made to open by default using the `defaultOpen` prop on `<Modal.Trigger />`.

Use the `useModalTrigger()` hook inside a Modal component to access the modal state. Use the modal trigger state to determine if the modal `isOpen`. The modal trigger state can also be used to programmatically `close()` the modal.

### Focus containment

A `<Modal />` traps focus until it's closed. When a modal is closed, it returns focus to the element that triggered the modal.

## Simple Example

In its simplest form, a `<Modal />` requires a triggering element and a `<Modal />` that renders a header, body, and footer.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Simple} />

## Complete Example

A `<Modal />` has several options across its components to customize the experience. The example below showcases the different available options.

Refer to the property tables at the bottom of the page for full documentation on what's available.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Complete} />

## Nondismissable

By default, `<Modal />`s are dismissable, meaning a user can exit the modal without performing an action. Exiting can be done by clicking on the underlay behind the modal, pressing the `Esc` key, or clicking the close icon in the header.

To override that behavior, set `isDismissable` to `false` on the `<Modal.Trigger />`.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Nondismissable} />

<Controls of={ModalStories.Nondismissable} />

## Size

A `<Modal />` comes in three sizes—`sm`, `md`, or `lg`—which governs the width of the modal. Use the `size` prop on `<Modal />` to change its size. Modals default to `lg`.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Size} />

<Controls of={ModalStories.Size} />

## Custom Triggers

A `<Modal />` can be wrapped in a `<ModalContainer />` to entirely control the triggering process.

A `<ModalContainer />` accepts a single `<Modal />` as a child. If no child is provided, the `<ModalContainer />` renders itself as closed. Use the `onDismiss` prop to know when the modal closes.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.MenuTrigger} />
