# Modal

A `<Modal />` is a page overlay that displays information and blocks interaction with the page until an action is taken or the `Modal` is dismissed.

A `<Modal />` traps focus until it's closed at which point it returns focus to the element that triggered the modal.

`<Modal />` is a compound component. Use `<Modal.Trigger />`, `<Modal />`, `<Modal.Header />`, `<Modal.Body />`, and `<Modal.Footer />` to construct a modal.

`<Modal.Trigger />` must contain exactly two direct children. The first child should be a trigger element, such as a `<Button />`, where the trigger events and appropriate accessibility attributes can be applied. The second element must be a `<Modal />`. If access to programmatically close the modal is needed, a child with a function that has a close method and returns a `<Modal />` (`(close) => <Modal />`) can be passed as the second child instead of a `<Modal />`. See the examples below for reference.

By default, a `<Modal />` manages its own open state. It can be made to be a controlled component by using the `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` prop on `<Modal.Trigger />`. Additionally, it can be made to open by default using the `defaultOpen` prop on `<Modal.Trigger />`.

## A Complete Example

A `<Modal />` has several options across its components to customize the experience. The example below showcases the different available options.

Refer to the property tables at the bottom of the page for full documentation on what's available.

## Nondismissable

By default, `<Modal />`s are dismissable, meaning a user can exit the modal without performing an action. Exiting can be done by clicking on the underlay behind the modal, pressing the `Esc` key, or clicking the close icon in the header.

To override that behavior, set `isDismissable` to `false` on the `<Modal.Trigger />`.

## Size

A `<Modal />` comes in three sizes—`sm`, `md`, or `lg`—which governs the width of the modal. Use the `size` prop on `<Modal />` to change its size. Modals default to `lg`.
