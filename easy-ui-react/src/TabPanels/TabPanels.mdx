# TabPanels

`TabPanels` organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them. The content under the set of tabs should be related and form a coherent unit.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.Default} />

`TabPanels` should not be used for links that navigate the user to a new URL. If you want tab-like navigation, use [`TabNav`](/?path=/docs/components-tabs-tabnav--docs) instead.

`TabPanels` is a compound component consisting of `TabPanels`, `TabPanels.Tabs`, `TabPanels.Panels`, and `TabPanels.Item` for individual tabs and panels. Tabs and panels are associated by the `key`s on their respective `TabPanels.Item`.

```tsx
<TabPanels aria-label="History of Rome">
  <TabPanels.Tabs>
    <TabPanels.Item key="for">Founding of Rome</TabPanels.Item>
    <TabPanels.Item key="mar">Monarchy and Republic</TabPanels.Item>
    <TabPanels.Item key="emp">Empire</TabPanels.Item>
  </TabPanels.Tabs>
  <TabPanels.Panels>
    <TabPanels.Item key="for">
      Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris.
    </TabPanels.Item>
    <TabPanels.Item key="mar">Senatus Populusque Romanus.</TabPanels.Item>
    <TabPanels.Item key="emp">Alea jacta est.</TabPanels.Item>
  </TabPanels.Panels>
</TabPanels>
```

## Controlled

`TabPanels` can be controlled using the `selectedKey` and `onSelectionChange` props.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.Controlled} />

<Controls of={TabPanelsStories.Controlled} />

## Default Selection

`TabPanels` can have a tab selected by default using `defaultSelectedKey`.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.DefaultSelectedKey} />

<Controls of={TabPanelsStories.DefaultSelectedKey} />

## Disabled List

`TabPanels` can be disabled entirely using `isDisabled`.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.DisabledList} />

<Controls of={TabPanelsStories.DisabledList} />

## Disabled Items

`TabPanels` can have individually disabled items using `disabledKeys`.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.DisabledItems} />

## Manual Keyboard Activation

By default, tabs in `TabPanels` are automatically activated when the user moves across them with the `Left` or `Right` keyboard arrows. This behavior can be altered to require the user to press `Enter` or `Space` to activate a tab. Set `keyboardActivation` to `manual` for this behavior.

This is a good idea to enable if the tab requires an asynchronous process on load.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.ManualKeyboardActivation} />

<Controls of={TabPanelsStories.ManualKeyboardActivation} />

## Responsive

`TabPanels` scrolls horizontally when it's wider than the width of its container.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.Responsive} />

## Custom Layout

`TabPanels.Tabs` and `TabPanels.Panels` are not required to be the immediate children of `TabPanels`. If you need additional structure in-between, `TabPanels` supports this.

<Canvas of={TabPanelsStories.CustomLayout} />
