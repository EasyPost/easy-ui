# TabPanels

`TabPanels` is a set of tabs that let users switch between multiple views within a related context under the same URL.

Tabs organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them. The content under the set of tabs should be related and form a coherent unit.

Tabs in a tab panel should not be links that navigate the user to a new URL. If you want tab-like navigation, use `TabNav` instead.
